# Student-Management-System-Flask

## Description

This is a simple API using Flask and MongoDB. The application can perform CRUD operations and store the data in the 
database. The motivation of the project is to learn the basic concepts of Flask and MongoDB and implement them.
* **Flask** is a lightweight web application framework designed to get results fast and leave room to make the app more detailed in the future.
   Here we do not having to follow a strict convention, hence it could accelerate the development process and gives developers the added flexibility.
* As a document database, **MongoDB** makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents. This format directly maps to native objects in most modern programming languages, making it a natural choice for developers, as they donâ€™t need to think about normalizing data. MongoDB can also handle high volume and can scale both vertically or horizontally to accommodate large data loads.
